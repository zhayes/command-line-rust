  <h1>Colophon</h1>

  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>Command-Line Rust</em> is a fiddler crab, a small crustacean sharing a common name with more than 100 species in the family Ocypodidae, made up of semiterrestrial crabs.</p>

  <p>Fiddler crabs are perhaps best known for the oversized claw that distinguishes males and that is used for communication, courtship, and competitive behaviors. Fiddlers eat microorganisms, algae, decaying plants, and fungi, sifting through sand and mud for edible matter. They live relatively short lives—generally no more than two to three years—and can be found in the salt marshes and beach habitats of several regions around the world.</p>

  <p>Many of the animals on O’Reilly covers are endangered. While fiddler crabs are not rare, they, like all animals, are important to the world and the ecosystems of which they are a part.</p>

  <p>The cover illustration is by Karen Montgomery, based on an antique line engraving from <em>Brehms Thierleben</em>. The cover fonts are Gilroy Semibold and Guardian Sans. The text font is Adobe Minion Pro; the heading font is Adobe Myriad Condensed; and the code font is Dalton Maag’s Ubuntu Mono.</p>
